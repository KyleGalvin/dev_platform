# SeaSprig

This repository is, in essence, using tilt and docker to squeeze an entire microservices development ecosystem onto a single workstation.

With one command, you can build it up. you can tear the whole thing down with another. Each service has hot-reloading enabled whenever files are saved.

Out of the box, you get a database, an oauth2 provider, grafana, rabbitmq, a markdown-based documentation service, and example client/server applications ready to be sculpted to your needs in the moment.
