# Mkdocs

[Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/ "mkdocs.org") is a file-based wiki tool used by the SeaSprig platform for project documentation.

Mkdocs are written in [markdown](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/ "writing mkdocs markdown") in the ./mkdocs/docs/ folder and are automatically compiled and rendered on save. By checking the static documentation pages into git, the site is portable to all development environments that clone the SeaSprig platform.
